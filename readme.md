# Impact Meter

Impact Meter is a web-based platform focused on applying generative AI and data-driven solutions to optimize cement industry operations. The project aims to address the root causes of inefficiency, high emissions, and operational challenges in cement manufacturing, with a special emphasis on modular, small-scale, clinkerless production and advanced process optimization.

## Features

- **AI-driven Kiln Optimization:** Real-time recommendations for temperature, fuel mix, and process parameters to reduce energy consumption and emissions.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Early fault detection for critical equipment using time-series sensor data and machine learning.
- **Quality Control:** Inline computer vision inspection for clinker and cement quality.
- **Supply Chain Forecasting:** Raw material demand prediction and logistics optimization.
- **Alternative Binder Formulation:** Generative AI for mix design of low-carbon, waste-utilizing cement alternatives.
- **Automated Reporting:** Sustainability and compliance report generation from process data.

## Motivation

Cement manufacturing is responsible for ~8% of global CO₂ emissions, with most problems rooted in the energy-intensive clinker production process. This project explores actionable AI solutions and modular plant architectures to break the clinker dependency and enable sustainable, decentralized cement production.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **AI/ML:** Google Vertex AI, Vision AI, Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Data:** Synthetic and public datasets for cement operations, sensor feeds, and image analysis
